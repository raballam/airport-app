# AIRPORT PLANE CONTROL FLOW MANAGER

The primary role of an air traffic controller is to uphold high standards of safety on the runway. Controlling the flow of air traffic is crucial in order to avoid delays and accidents, and the process of verifying arrival and departure requests can be time consuming and prone to human error. This software monitors current conditions in the airport and automates the verification process. This removes routine tasks from responsibility of air traffic control, improving efficiency and eliminating mistakes.

## Benefits

The software streamlines the workflow of air traffic control, standardises practices across teams and offers demonstrable adherence to airport health and safety practices. Its use allows personnel to manage their time more effectively, leading to improved standards and growth across the board.

Using this software makes sure communications can be accurate and professional and flight crews can be sure that the airport has strict safety protocols. The seamless functionality behind the scenes ensures passengers have a relaxing and reassuring travel experience, eliminating delays and marking the airport as a reliable travel choice for commuters and holiday makers alike.

This is achieved with the following features:

- **Adjustable Capacity**

The software sets the maximum capacity of the airport. A default capacity allows general levels to be set, and this can be overridden to ensure no change to standard practices in circumstances such as terminal closures and runway maintenance.

- **Plane Tracking**

A list of planes currently at the airport is automatically adjusted as planes arrive and depart. This allows air traffic control to identify when capacity levels have been reached, know what planes are currently at the airport and communicate effectively with flight crews.

- **Weather Alerts**

The software also monitors current weather and informs air traffic control when there is an active storm, ensuring runway conditions are safe before any communication takes place with flight crews.

- **Verifies Arrival/Departure Requests**

When requests are received by the airport, this software automatically checks the capacity, current weather conditions and identification of the plane before verifying or denying the request. This ensures air traffic control can be confident in their communications with flight crews and upholds high standards of safety on the runway.


## Risks

There are some risks associated with this product.

As personnel are able to adjust airport capacity, there is some possibility of human error. It may be useful to include pre-set options for different circumstances. In addition, there is no way for personnel to override the system if it is refusing or accepting a plane, before it is added or removed from the list of planes. Occasions may arise where air traffic control may wish to refuse or accept traffic based on factors outwith the scope of this program and it could be improved by included some capacity to do this.

The data recorded about the airport is limited. The traffic flow of the airport could be better managed by including more information about the planes, eg. the size, number of passengers and turnaround time.

Currently, the weather conditions are only considered unsafe during storms. It may be helpful to also consider factors such as visibility and wind speed, and perhaps include an ‘amber’ warning when conditions are suboptimal but not severe enough to warrant a closure.

Finally, planes are removed from the record at the time that they are cleared for take off, some time before the plane will actually leave the airport. It would be safer to do this when the flight crew confirms a successful departure, so that air traffic control can identify *every* plane using the airport at any time.
